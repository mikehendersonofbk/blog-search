# Blog Search API Project

This project aims to make a tab delimited list of blogs searchable in an Elasticsearch index. It consists of two parts - an indexing CLI tool and a service that will be queried via an endpoint.

## To Run
This project runs in a Docker network. To start up the network, simply run:

```
cd /path/to/project/repo
docker-compose up
```
